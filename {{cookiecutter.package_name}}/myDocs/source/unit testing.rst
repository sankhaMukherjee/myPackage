Unit Testing
============

It is very important to do unit testing for your programs.
The current documentation uses `pytest` as well as `tox` 
for testign your documents. All testing code should be
present in the `test` folder. 

An example unit testing is already present, and as new functionality
is added to your system it is important to add unit tests to this
system. 

For testing either use 

- `make tests`: for generating unit testing for the current environment, or
- `tox`: for performing unit testing for the entire system
